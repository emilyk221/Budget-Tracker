  ## Description
  This application is a budget tracking app that has been updated to have offline functionality. Users can enter their money transactions into the form and their total, list of transactions, and chart of the total over time are updated. The database storing a user's transactions is also updated while the app is online. A service worker has been included in order to locally cache files relavent to the app's basic funcionality. Data saved on the app while offline is temporarily stored locally in IndexedDB and is transferred to the database when the app is back online. Also, a mainfest.json file was added in order to convert this app to a Progressive Web Application, or PWA. PWAs are increasing in popularity and it is important to understand how these functional pieces work together to create a good user experience offline.
